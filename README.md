# COME ON AND SLAM #

A webservice has been hacked and is still vulnerable!   
Hackers have released data containing usernames, and some sort of hashed value.   
The engineers behind tthis service were experementing with some new, strange hashing algorithm.   
Log in and grab some fresh user data while it's still hot!   

## CHALLENGE ##
Vulnerable web service: [lwapd.pythonanywhere.com/spacejam256](lwapd.pythonanywhere.com/spacejam256)   
The leaked data is in password_dump.txt        
Also, an example hash-reverser written in python is included    
For maxumum fun, turn your volume on full blast
